1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,070
You can't connect the dots looking forward,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,200
you can only connect them looking backwards.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,520
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,130
You have to trust in something:

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,750
your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,070
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,290
will give you the confidence to follow your heart,

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,530
even when it leads you off the well worn path.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,120
And that will make all the diffrence.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,270
Your time is limited,

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,220
so don't waste it living someone else's life.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,180
Don't be trapped by dogma:

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,230
which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,380
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,360
You've got to find what you love.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,430
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,080
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,070
and the only way to be truly satisfied

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,160
is to do what you believe is great work.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,260
And the only way to do great work...

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,040
is to love what you do

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,019
If you haven't found it yet,

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,239
keep looking.

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,230
and don't settle.

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,120
what you truly want to become.

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,040
You’re going to have some ups and you’re going to have some downs

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,110
Most people give up on themselves easily.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,100
You know the human spirit is powerful?

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,140
There is nothing as powerful – it’s hard to kill the human spirit!

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,360
Anybody can feel good when they have their health, their bills are paid, they have happy relationships.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,250
Anybody can have a larger vision then,

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,700
Anybody can have a large vision then,

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,030
anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,910
comes when get knocked down.

35
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,720
It takes courage to act.

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,320
Part of being hungry when you have been defeated.

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,020
It takes courage...

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,020
to start over again.

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,150
Fear kills dreams.

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,550
Fear kills hope.

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,670
Fear...

42
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,250
Fear... put people in the hospital.

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,510
Fear can age you

44
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,240
can hold you back from doing something that you know within yourself that you are capable of doing,

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:43,220
but it will paralyze you.

46
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,000
At the end of your feelings is nothing,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,070
but at the end of every principle is a promise.

48
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,130
Behind your little feelings, it might not be absolutely nothing at the end of your little feelings.

49
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,580
But behind every principle is a promise.

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,080
And some of you in your life

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,100
the reason why you not at your goal right now, because you just all about your feelings.

52
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,260
All on your feelings, you don’t feel like waking up – who does?

53
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,030
Everyday you say 'no' to your dreams,

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,150
you might be pushing your dreams back a whole six months, a whole year!

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:22,260
That one single day, that one day you didn’t get up could have pushed your stuff back I don’t know how long.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,090
Don't allow your emotion to control you.

57
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,010
If you don't discipline and contain your emotion, they will use you.

58
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,110
and you’re going to go all out to have it.

59
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,090
It’s not going to be easy, when you want to change,

60
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,250
it’s not easy. If it were in fact easy, everybody would do it.

61
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:01,100
But if you’re serious, you’ll go all out.

62
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,150
I'm in control here.

63
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,180
I’m not going to let this get me down, I’m not going to let this destroy me.

64
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm coming back!

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,270
And I'll be stronger and better because of it!

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,160
That this is what you stand for!

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,170
Take full responsibility for your life.

68
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:34,230
Accept where you are and the responsibility that you’re going to take yourself where you want to go.

69
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,170
You can decide that I am going to live each day as if it were my last!

70
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,110
Live your life with passion!

71
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,100
With some drive.

72
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,070
Decided that you are going to push yourself.

73
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,130
The last chapter to your life has not been written yet,

74
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,080
and it doesn’t matter about what happened yesterday

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
It doesn’t matter about what happened to you, what matters is:

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
‘what are you going to do about it?’

77
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,010
This year I will make this goal become a reality.

78
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,180
I won’t talk about it anymore.

79
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,050
I can.

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,020
I can!

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,240
I CAN !

82
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,520
To persevere I think is important for everybody.

83
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,020
Don't give up, don't give in.

84
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,240
There's always an answer to everything

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
